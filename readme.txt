TOUCHDOWN
---------

Idea:
	Touchdown is a game in which you, a football player, must
	avoid all the oppponent defenders for as long as you can.
	
	The game is set in a football stadium, and you can score repeatedly
	in both end zones.
	Staying in either end zone of the stadium will increase your
	score.
	The game ends when a defender makes contact with you,
	so avoid one at all costs.
	The defenders move very quickly, so this game is extra
	challenging, but they move in a predictable manner, so make sure
	you get out of the way just in time.

Objective:
	- Stay away from the defenders
	- Stay in the end zones (marked as white lines at each end) to score
	- Scoring is infinite but "win" the game by getting a score of
	  over 2000.
	- Get as high of a score as you can.

Controls:
	- Press SELECT (mapped to the ENTER key) at any time to go
	  back to the home screen
	- Press the direction keys to move the player (Red rectangle)
	  around the stadium (make sure to spend more time in the end
	  zones for a higher score)
